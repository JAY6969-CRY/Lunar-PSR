# Lunar-PSR Image Enhancer

## Overview

The Lunar-PSR Image Enhancer is a tool designed to enhance low-light images captured by Chandrayaan-2's OHRC. It aims to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remove noise, and preserve critical geomorphological details for lunar craters. This project involves integrating frontend and backend technologies to provide a user-friendly interface for image enhancement.

## Features

- Enhance low-light images using advanced image processing techniques.
- Improve signal-to-noise ratio and remove noise.
- Preserve critical geomorphological details in lunar crater images.
- User-friendly web interface for uploading and viewing enhanced images.
